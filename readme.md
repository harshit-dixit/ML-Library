MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS

Implemented following machine learning algorithms in python :

1. **Linear Regression** : 
    
2. **Logistic Regresssion module** :

3. **K-nearest neighbour** :

4. **K-means algorithm** :

5. **Deicision Tree** :

6. **Neural Network** :

Made different modules for each algorithm. Each module is kept in separate folders. Each folder contain a alogrithm code file, jypter notebook depicting the implementation and dataset.
